# FlixScroll: Trending Movies Showcase
Welcome to FlixScroll, an immersive iOS application that brings the latest trending movies right to your fingertips. Developed as part of the iOS Application Development course with CodePath, this project demonstrates the power of Swift and UIKit in creating dynamic and engaging user interfaces. By fetching data from The Movie Database (TMDB) API, FlixScroll offers users a seamless experience to explore movie titles, descriptions, and visually striking poster images.

## Features
FlixScroll includes the following key features:

* Dynamic Data Fetching: Utilizes The Movie Database (TMDB) API to fetch an array of the latest trending movies.
* Custom Table Views: Displays a scrolling list of movies, where each entry shows the movie's poster image, title, and a brief description.
* Remote Image Loading: Efficiently loads and displays remote images given a URL, enhancing the app's responsiveness and visual appeal.
* Interactive UI: Employs custom table view cells to improve user interaction and app aesthetics.
